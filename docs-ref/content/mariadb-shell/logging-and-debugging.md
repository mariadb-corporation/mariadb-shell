# Logging and Debugging

MariaDB Shell writes an application log that records what the shell does: startup, connections, plugin loading, errors, and, if you ask for it, the SQL statements it runs. The log is the first place to look when a connection fails, a plugin doesn't load, or a utility reports `Check mariadb-shell.log for more warnings`.

Three independent outputs are available:

| Output | Controlled by | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application log file | `--log-file`, `--log-level`, `--log-sql` | Shell events and, optionally, SQL statements. |
| Console | `--verbose`, or `--log-level` with an `@` prefix | The same kind of messages, printed while the shell runs. |
| System log | `--syslog` | The statements you enter interactively. |

## Log File Location

| Platform | Default log file |
| --- | --- |
| Linux and macOS | `~/.mariadb-shell/mariadb-shell.log` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\MariaDB\mariadb-shell\mariadb-shell.log` |

The log file is in the per-user configuration directory. If you set the `MARIADB_SHELL_USER_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable to move that directory, the log file moves with it. To write the log somewhere else for one session, use `--log-file`:

```sh
mariadb-shell --log-file=/tmp/msh-debug.log --log-level=debug root@db1.example.com
```

The shell appends to the file and never rotates it. Delete or truncate it yourself when it grows too large.

In the shell, `shell.options.logFile` shows the file in use. The option is read-only; change it only with `--log-file` at startup.

```text
MariaDB localhost:3306 ssl  Py > shell.options.logFile
/home/dev/.mariadb-shell/mariadb-shell.log
```

Each line has a timestamp, the process and thread IDs, the level, and the message:

```text
2026-10-05 16:52:39 [76714:20558725]: Info: Connecting to MySQL at: root@localhost:4406
2026-10-05 16:52:39 [76714:20558725]: Info: main: tid=0: CONNECTED: localhost:4406
```

The log text "Connecting to MySQL" refers to the client protocol and appears for MariaDB Server too.

## Log Level

`--log-level` sets how much detail the log contains. The default is `info` (5). Each level includes the levels above it.

| Value | Name | Logs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1` | `none` | Nothing. |
| `2` | `internal` | Internal errors of the shell. |
| `3` | `error` | Errors. |
| `4` | `warning` | Warnings. |
| `5` | `info` | Informational messages, such as connections and loaded plugins. This is the default. |
| `6` | `debug` | Debugging information, such as plugin search paths and credential store activity. |
| `7` | `debug2` | More detailed debugging information. |
| `8` | `debug3` | The most detailed debugging information. |

You can give the number or the name. Prefix the value with `@` to also write the log messages to standard error:

```sh
mariadb-shell --log-level=@debug --sql -e "SELECT 1" root@localhost
```

The same values work for the `logLevel` option, which you can change at runtime or persist in the [configuration](customizing/configuration-options.md). Reading the option returns the number:

```text
MariaDB localhost:3306 ssl  Py > shell.options.logLevel = "debug2"
MariaDB localhost:3306 ssl  Py > shell.options.logLevel
7
MariaDB localhost:3306 ssl  Py > shell.options.set_persist("logLevel", "debug")
```

## Verbose Console Output

`--verbose` prints diagnostic messages to the console as they happen, without changing what goes into the log file. This is convenient when you test a connection from the command line.

| Value | Prints |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Nothing. This is the default. |
| `1` | Errors, warnings, and informational messages. `--verbose` without a value means `1`. |
| `2`, `3`, `4` | Increasingly detailed debug messages. |

```text
$ mariadb-shell --verbose root@localhost:3306 --sql -e "SELECT 1"
verbose: 2026-10-05T18:52:39Z: Loading startup files...
verbose: 2026-10-05T18:52:39Z: Loading plugins...
verbose: 2026-10-05T18:52:39Z: Connecting to MySQL at: root@localhost:3306
verbose: 2026-10-05T18:52:39Z: main: tid=0: CONNECTED: localhost:3306
1
1
```

The corresponding option is `verbose`, with the values `0` to `4`.

## Logging SQL Statements

`--log-sql` controls whether the SQL statements that the shell sends to the server are written to the application log. This covers statements you type in SQL mode, statements run by `session.run_sql()` in Python, and statements run by the utilities. Statements are logged at the `info` level, so the log level must be `info` or higher.

| Value | Logs |
| --- | --- |
| `off` | No statements. |
| `error` | Only statements that fail, together with the error. This is the default. |
| `on` | All statements, except those that match a pattern in `logSql.ignorePattern` or `logSql.ignorePatternUnsafe`. |
| `all` | All statements, except those that match a pattern in `logSql.ignorePatternUnsafe`. |
| `unfiltered` | All statements, without exceptions. |

The two pattern options hold colon-separated lists of glob patterns, matched against the whole statement:

| Option | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `logSql.ignorePattern` | `*SELECT*:*SHOW*` | Keeps read-only statements out of the log with `--log-sql=on`. |
| `logSql.ignorePatternUnsafe` | `*IDENTIFIED*:*PASSWORD*` | Keeps statements that can contain passwords out of the log with `on` and `all`. |

For example, the following command logs every statement except those that can contain passwords:

```sh
mariadb-shell --log-sql=all --sql root@localhost -f migrate.sql
```

With the default patterns, the log then contains a `DROP USER` statement from the script but not the `CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED BY` statement before it. A failing statement is logged together with its error:

```text
2026-10-05 16:52:39 [76714:20558725]: Info: main: tid=71: SQL: SELECT nosuchcol FROM shop.customers
2026-10-05 16:52:39 [76714:20558725]: Info: main: tid=71: MySQL Error 1054 (42S22): Unknown column 'nosuchcol' in 'SELECT'
```

`tid` is the connection ID on the server, which helps you match log entries with the server's process list or general query log.

{% hint style="warning" %}
`--log-sql=unfiltered` writes every statement to the log, including statements that contain passwords in clear text. Use it only for short troubleshooting sessions, and delete the log afterward.
{% endhint %}

To change SQL logging at runtime, set the `logSql` option:

```python
shell.options.logSql = "on"
shell.options["logSql.ignorePattern"] = "*SELECT*:*SHOW*:SET *"
```

## Logging to the System Log

`--syslog` sends the statements that you enter interactively to the operating system log: to syslog with the identifier `mariadb-shell` and the `user` facility on Linux and macOS, or to the Windows Event Log on Windows. This supports auditing of what administrators run by hand. Statements run from a script with `-f` or `-e` are not logged.

The shell logs SQL statements and the `\source` and `\.` commands. Each entry has the following fields:

```text
SYSTEM_USER=dev MYSQL_USER=root CONNECTION_ID=71 DB_SERVER=localhost DB=shop QUERY=DELETE FROM orders WHERE id = 42
```

A field without a value shows `--`. Entries are cut at 1024 characters.

The same filter as for the command history applies: statements that match a pattern in the `history.sql.ignorePattern` option are not sent to the system log. The default pattern, `*IDENTIFIED*:*PASSWORD*`, keeps statements that can contain passwords out of the system log. You can also set the patterns with `--histignore`.

To enable system logging permanently, persist the `history.sql.syslog` option:

```python
shell.options.set_persist("history.sql.syslog", True)
```

On Windows, the shell needs a registry key for its Event Log source. Run the shell once with administrator rights, or with sufficient privileges to create the key, before you use `--syslog` as a regular user.

## Troubleshooting Tips

* **Connection problems.** Run the failing command with `--verbose=4`, or with `--log-level=@debug3`, to see each step of the connection, including SSH tunnel setup.
* **Plugins that don't load.** Plugin errors are written to the log at startup. Start with `--log-level=debug` to also see where the shell looks for plugins. See [Plugins](extending-mariadb-shell/plugins.md).
* **Utility warnings.** When a utility such as `util.import_table()` produces many warnings, it prints the first few and writes all of them to the log.
* **Credential store problems.** Start with `--log-level=debug` and search the log for `helper`. See [Credential Store](connecting/credential-store.md).
* **Support requests.** Include the relevant part of the log. Check it for host names, user names, and statement text you don't want to share before you send it.
