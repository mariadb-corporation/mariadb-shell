# Dump and Load Tools

The `util` tools of the MCP server run the [dump](../utilities/dump-and-load/dump-utilities.md), [load](../utilities/dump-and-load/load-dump-utility.md), [copy](../utilities/dump-and-load/copy-utilities.md), [export and import](../utilities/table-export-and-import.md) utilities of MariaDB Shell on a connection opened with `db.connect`. These utilities run for minutes or hours, longer than an MCP client waits for a tool call to return, so each tool starts the work as a background **task** and returns its ID at once. The client then follows the task, and can cancel it.

The server provides these tools only when it provides the `db` group as well, and never in [multi-tenant mode](multi-tenant-mode.md).

## Tools

| Tool | Does | Arguments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `util.dump_instance` | Runs `util.dump_instance()`. | `connection_id`, `output_url`, `options` |
| `util.dump_schemas` | Runs `util.dump_schemas()`. | `connection_id`, `schemas`, `output_url`, `options` |
| `util.dump_tables` | Runs `util.dump_tables()`. | `connection_id`, `schema`, `tables`, `output_url`, `options` |
| `util.export_table` | Runs `util.export_table()`. | `connection_id`, `table`, `output_url`, `options` |
| `util.load_dump` | Runs `util.load_dump()`. | `connection_id`, `url`, `options` |
| `util.import_table` | Runs `util.import_table()`. | `connection_id`, `urls` (a file or a list; names may contain `*` and `?`), `options` |
| `util.copy_instance` | Runs `util.copy_instance()`. | `connection_id`, `target_connection_id`, `options` |
| `util.copy_schemas` | Runs `util.copy_schemas()`. | `connection_id`, `schemas`, `target_connection_id`, `options` |
| `util.copy_tables` | Runs `util.copy_tables()`. | `connection_id`, `schema`, `tables`, `target_connection_id`, `options` |
| `util.get_task` | Returns the state of a task. | `task_id`, `since`, `wait_ms` |
| `util.list_tasks` | Lists the tasks of the client. | None |
| `util.cancel_task` | Stops a task. | `task_id` |

`options` holds the utility's own options, with their camelCase names, for example `{"threads": 8, "users": false}`. The tools set `session`, `progressCallback`, and `showProgress` themselves, and refuse them in `options`.

Each start tool returns the task's ID and status:

```json
{"task_id": "4c0d0f0e-5a51-4a34-9c6e-0b8d2f3c1e77", "status": "running"}
```

## Following a Task

`util.get_task` returns the task's state:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `status` | `pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. |
| `title`, `kind` | What the task does, such as `Dump shop to /backups/shop` and `dump_schemas`. |
| `stages` | The stages of the utility so far, such as `Gathering information`, `Writing DDL`, and `Dumping data`, each with its status and, once finished, its duration in seconds. |
| `stage`, `progress` | The current stage and its progress: `current`, `total`, and `percent`. For a stage that moves data, also `throughput` (items per second), `eta_seconds`, and `items` (`bytes` or `rows`). |
| `messages` | What the utility printed after `since`, each with `seq`, `time`, `level` (such as `status`, `warning`, or `error`), and `text`. |
| `next_since` | The `since` for the next call, to get only new messages. Leave `since` out on the first call. |
| `result`, `error` | Once the task ended: what it produced, such as the dump's folder, or why it failed. |

With `wait_ms` (at most 30000), the call answers as soon as the task changes, for example at its next progress update, so a client need not poll in a tight loop. It answers at once when there are new messages or the task has ended:

```json
{"task_id": "4c0d0f0e-5a51-4a34-9c6e-0b8d2f3c1e77", "since": 12, "wait_ms": 30000}
```

Once `status` is `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`, the task doesn't change any more.

## Cancelling a Task

`util.cancel_task` stops the utility at its next progress update, as Ctrl+C does when you run it in MariaDB Shell, and the task ends as `cancelled`. A load that was cancelled [resumes where it stopped](../utilities/dump-and-load/load-dump-utility.md#resuming-an-interrupted-load) when you load the same dump again.

## How Tasks Run

* **A task has a session of its own.** It's opened on the connection that `connection_id` names, with the same checks as a session that is [reopened after an idle period](security-and-session-handling.md#session-lifetime). The connection's own session stays free, so other tools can use it while the task runs.
* **Tasks belong to the client that started them,** as [connections do](security-and-session-handling.md#connections-belong-to-the-client-that-opened-them). To another client, the task doesn't exist.
* **Limits:** a client can run four tasks at the same time. A finished task is kept for one hour, and the server keeps 100 finished tasks at most.
* **Paths** are checked against the [allowed directories](configuring-access.md#allowed-paths). A URL, and an object storage prefix given with `s3BucketName`, `osBucketName`, or `azureContainerName`, are passed to the utility unchecked.

The tools need a MariaDB Shell whose utilities accept the `session` and `progressCallback` options; see [Running on Your Own Session](../utilities/dump-and-load/dump-utilities.md#running-on-your-own-session). With an older shell, every task fails with a message saying so.
