  Reference for util.copy_instance, util.copy_schemas and util.copy_tables,
  which copy data and objects directly from one MariaDB server to another
  without writing a dump to disk.
---

# Copy Utilities

The copy utilities run a dump and a load at the same time and connect them in memory. The source is the server of the global session; the target is a second server that you name with connection data. No files are written, and the target starts loading as soon as the first chunks are read from the source.

| Function | Copies | Equivalent to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `util.copy_instance()` | Every user schema, plus accounts, roles and grants. | `util.dump_instance()` + `util.load_dump()` |
| `util.copy_schemas()` | The schemas you list. | `util.dump_schemas()` + `util.load_dump()` |
| `util.copy_tables()` | The tables, views and sequences you list from one schema. | `util.dump_tables()` + `util.load_dump()` |

The options are those of the [dump utilities](dump-utilities.md) and of the [load utility](load-dump-utility.md), minus the ones that concern files. The [option tables](#options) below list exactly which ones each copy accepts.

## Syntax

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
util.copy_instance(connectionData[, options])
util.copy_schemas(schemas, connectionData[, options])
util.copy_tables(schema, tables, connectionData[, options])
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Command line" %}
```sh
mariadb-shell <source> -- util copy-instance <target> [--option=value ...]
mariadb-shell <source> -- util copy-schemas <schema>[,<schema>...] <target> [--option=value ...]
mariadb-shell <source> -- util copy-tables <schema> <table>[,<table>...] <target> [--option=value ...]
```

See [Command Line Integration](../../using-mariadb-shell/command-line-integration.md).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `connectionData` | The target server, as a URI string such as `"admin@db2.example.com:3306"` or a dictionary of connection options. Both forms accept everything a shell connection accepts, including `mariadb+ssh://` tunnels and TLS options. See [Connection URIs and Options](../../connecting/connection-uris-and-options.md). |
| `schemas` | `copy_schemas` only. A non-empty list of schema names. |
| `schema` | `copy_tables` only. The schema that holds the tables. |
| `tables` | `copy_tables` only. A list of table, view and sequence names. Pass an empty list together with `{"all": True}` to copy the whole schema. |
| `options` | A dictionary of options. |

If the target connection fails, the copy stops with `Could not connect to the target instance: ...` before it reads anything from the source. When the target URI has no password and none is stored, the shell prompts for it in interactive mode.

## Requirements

* A global session to the source server. Without one, the copy raises an error.
* **Same vendor on both ends.** A MariaDB source copies only to a MariaDB target. A mismatch is refused before anything is read:

  ```text
  The source instance is MariaDB and the target instance is MySQL. Copying across server vendors is not supported.
  ```
* The privileges of a dump on the source account and of a load on the target account. See [Dump Utilities](dump-utilities.md#privileges) and [Load Dump Utility](load-dump-utility.md#privileges).
* `local_infile` enabled on the target, as for any load. See [Local Data Loading](load-dump-utility.md#local-data-loading).
* The same version rules as `util.load_dump()`: non-consecutive major versions need `ignoreVersion`.

## How a Copy Differs from Dump and Load

* **No dump, no progress file.** An interrupted copy cannot resume; run it again with `dropExistingObjects` or `ignoreExistingObjects`, or drop what was copied first.
* **No deadlock retries.** Data flows as a stream, so a chunk rolled back by a deadlock on the target cannot be resent; the copy fails instead.
* **Two thread pools.** `threads` sets both the number of reading sessions on the source and the number of loading sessions on the target.
* **Output.** Lines from the dumping side start with `SRC:` and lines from the loading side with `TGT:`. Load progress is not shown. At the end, the copy prints the binary log file, position and GTID position of the source at the time of the copy.
* **Fixed settings.** Data is not compressed; `loadDdl`, `loadData` and `loadUsers` follow `ddlOnly`, `dataOnly` and `users`; the target version is taken from the target server.

## Options

Options marked as not accepted are rejected with `Invalid options: <name>`.

### Not Accepted

The following dump and load options do not apply to a copy and are rejected: all remote storage options, `compression`, the data format options (`dialect`, `fields*`, `linesTerminatedBy`), `targetVersion`, `loadDdl`, `loadData`, `loadUsers`, `progressFile`, `resetProgress`, `waitDumpTimeout`, `showMetadata`, `backgroundThreads`, `characterSet` and `createInvisiblePKs`. `copy_schemas` also rejects the schema and user filters; `copy_tables` rejects every include and exclude filter except those for triggers.

{% hint style="info" %}
MySQL HeatWave Service options are not available for MariaDB sources. The built-in help lists `compatibility`, which is refused for a MariaDB source, and `ocimds` is not accepted at all. The library filters, `allowDataMasking` and `dataMaskingPolicies` have no effect on MariaDB.
{% endhint %}

## Examples

### Copy a Schema to Another Server

```text
MariaDB localhost:3306 ssl  Py > util.copy_schemas(["world"], "root@db2.example.com:3306", {"threads": 4})
Copying DDL and Data from in-memory FS, source: db1.example.com:3306, target: db2.example.com:3306.
SRC: Acquiring global read lock
SRC: Global read lock acquired
SRC: 1 schemas will be dumped and within them 1 table, 0 views.
SRC: All transactions have been started
SRC: Locking instance for backup
SRC: Global read lock has been released
SRC: Running data dump using 4 threads.
TGT: Dump is still ongoing, data will be loaded as it becomes available.
TGT: Target is MariaDB 12.3.2-MariaDB. Dump was produced from MariaDB 12.3.2-MariaDB
TGT: Checking for pre-existing objects - done
...
SRC: Rows written: 500
...
TGT: 1 chunks (500 rows, 11.18 KB) for 1 tables in 1 schemas were loaded in 0 sec (avg throughput 11.18 KB/s, 500.00 rows/s)
TGT: 2 DDL files were executed in 0 sec.
TGT: 0 warnings were reported during the load.

---
Dump_metadata:
  Binlog_file: ''
  Binlog_position: 0
  GTID_position: ''
```

The binary log fields are empty here because the source runs without a binary log.

### Rehearse a Copy

```python
util.copy_schemas(["world"], "root@db2.example.com:3306", {"dryRun": True})
```

The dry run checks privileges on the source, connects to the target, checks the versions and looks for existing objects, then reports `No data loaded.` If the schema already exists on the target, the dry run reports the conflicts as the real copy would.

### Copy Some Rows into a Differently Named Schema

```python
util.copy_tables("shop", ["customers"], "root@db2.example.com:3306", {
    "schema": "crm",
    "where": {"shop.customers": "country = 'DE'"},
})
```

```text
TGT: 1 chunks (500 rows, 17.94 KB) for 1 tables in 1 schemas were loaded in 0 sec (avg throughput 17.94 KB/s, 500.00 rows/s)
```

### Copy a Whole Server with Selected Accounts

```python
util.copy_instance("admin@db2.example.com:3306", {
    "excludeSchemas": ["staging"],
    "includeUsers": ["app", "reporting"],
    "threads": 8,
    "checksum": True,
})
```

### Copy Through an SSH Tunnel

```python
util.copy_schemas(["shop"], "mariadb+ssh://admin@db2.example.com:3306")
```

The shell opens an SSH connection to `db2.example.com` and reaches the target server through it, so a target that listens only on its loopback interface can be copied to. See [SSH Tunnels](../../connecting/ssh-tunnels.md) for bastion hosts and SSH options.
