# Print the DLLs every PE binary under a directory imports, as
#
#     <path relative to the root, forward slashes>\t<DLL name>
#
# Used by verify_package.sh's dependency audit on Windows. It reads the PE import
# directory directly rather than shelling out to dumpbin or objdump, because
# neither is present on a machine that has only unpacked a package -- and running
# there is the whole point of that script. The package's own bundled Python is
# guaranteed to be available, since verifying it is one of the other checks.
#
# Only the standard import directory is read, not the delay-load one: nothing in
# this package delay-loads, and a delay-loaded DLL would be a soft failure at
# first use rather than a load-time one.
#
# Run as: mariadb-shell --py -f pe_imports.py <package-root>
